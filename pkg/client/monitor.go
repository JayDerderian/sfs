this is the file for the background event-listener daemon.

this will listen for events like a file being saved within the client's drive, which will then
automatically start a new sync index operation. whether the user wants to automatically sync or not
should be a setting, but the daemon will automatically make a new sync index with each file or directory
modification.

should also have a mechanism to interrupt a sync operation if a new event occurs.
